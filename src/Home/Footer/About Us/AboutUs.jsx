                    <br/>
                    <p>The global pandemic has changed the ways in which various services are provided. In a digitalized world, a communicable threat such as the covid-19 has mandated remote communication, and through this, it has and still is, influencing the way we acquire those services. The severity of the infectious disease has minimized the ability of people to normally communicate and socialize with people upfront. This has made it increasingly difficult to seek medical assistance not only for health-conscious people but also for those who require medical assistance. The notion of seeking these solutions from various sources has become a challenge and a matter of confusion for the masses.</p>
