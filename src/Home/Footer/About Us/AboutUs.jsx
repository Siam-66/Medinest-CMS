                    <p>MediNest is a health care system that provides all kinds of medical services so that you do not have to harbor the headache of looking for them. We provide online emergency services 24/7. You can avail services such as oxygen supplies, ambulances, medical appointments, and tests from the comfort of your own home.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>The global pandemic has changed the ways in which various services are provided. In a digitalized world, a communicable threat such as the covid-19 has mandated remote communication, and through this, it has and still is, influencing the way we acquire those services. The severity of the infectious disease has minimized the ability of people to normally communicate and socialize with people upfront. This has made it increasingly difficult to seek medical assistance not only for health-conscious people but also for those who require medical assistance. The notion of seeking these solutions from various sources has become a challenge and a matter of confusion for the masses.</p>
